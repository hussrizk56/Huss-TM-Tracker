## Description
To create a Node.js command-line application with MySQL that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. The user will be able to add, delete, update and view the information stored on this database, which is known as a "Content Management System" (CMS).   

## Actions Taken
* Used Inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of prompts regarding which data would like to be viewed/modified/deleted (departments, employees, role ID, etc.) via the command-line interface. 
* Used MySQL for the database management interface to create the employees database with tables that "join" to other tables linked with IDs. 
* Used console.table to print the rows in the MySQL console.
